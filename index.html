          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>Mission Ready HQ gave me work experience while learning more about a technical job, â€¦ learning how to
            develop apps and javascript.. I was also getting work experience working for Crunch which gave me a bit of
            direction in what to study.</p>

          <h2>Vission</h2>
          <p>A vision is the bigger picture. Your life's vision defines who you want to be, what you want to be known
            for and the set of experiences and accomplishments you aim for. Your vision helps define the goals by giving
            you a framework to evaluate those goals.</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>Individuals can set personal goals: a student may set a goal of a high mark in an exam; an athlete might
            run five miles a day; a traveler might try to reach a destination city within three hours; an individual
            might try to reach financial goals such as saving for retirement or saving for a purchase.</p>

        <h1>What is Template <br>in HTML and CSS?</h1>
        <p>HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but
          may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript. Think of a template as a content fragment
          that is being stored for subsequent use in the document.</p>
